SHORT DESCRIPTION
    Windows Restart Manager PowerShell Module

LONG DESCRIPTION
    This is a PowerShell module that provides access to the Windows Restart
    Manager. You can use it in scripts to help avoid reboots when copying files
    that may be used by other programs, or to test your own products and
    installers for how they work with the Restart Manager.

EXAMPLES
    You can register files, processes, and services to see what processes are
    using them and, optionally, stop and restart them:

    Start-RestartManagerSession
    Get-ChildItem .\MyApp -Filter *.dll -Recurse | Register-RestartManagerResource
    Get-RestartManagerProcess
    Stop-RestartManagerSession

    If you want to stop and restart processes, before calling
    `Stop-RestartManagerSession` above call the following cmdlets:

    Stop-RestartManagerProcess
    # Perform other operations here, like copy over existing files.
    Restart-RestartManagerProcess

    You can find the session ID and key for the current Restart Manager session
    in the `$RestartManagerSession` property.
